This project no longer uses releases and tags to mark versions. Instead, it is embedded directly into APISIX itself by specifying the commit ID.

Check the roadmap (https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard/issues/2981) for this project. The first APISIX to include the new APISIX Dashboard, 3.13, has now been released.

APISIX Dashboard 3.0.1 is the last version to use the old release model. It should and only should be used with APISIX 3.0. Any higher or lower version has not been tested.

If you are a new APISIX user, it is highly recommended that you always start with the latest release rather than any historical version.
