### Quickstart

Emissary v4 supports both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. To install Emissary v4 using Helm, follow the instructions in the [Emissary Quickstart](https://emissary-ingress.dev/docs/4.0/quick-start/).

Emissary provides two Helm charts:

- `ghcr.io/emissary-ingress/emissary-crds-chart` is the chart for Emissary's CRDs.

- `ghcr.io/emissary-ingress/emissary-ingress` is the chart for Emissary itself.

The Emissary project recommends using Helm to install Emissary. If you need YAML instead, use `helm template` to generate the YAML manifests from the Helm charts.

### Breaking Changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Emissary is now built using `distroless` and Envoy 1.36.2 with **no custom Envoy changes**, and almost all code specific to Ambassador Edge Stack has been removed to lessen maintenance burdens (with thanks to [Luke Shumaker] for jumping back in to help with tooling work!).

  As a result, Ambassador Edge Stack's custom error responses and header-case mangling features are completely unavailable in Emissary (which should not affect any Emissary users).

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The Helm chart and Emissary itself now have aligned version numbers (e.g., use chart 4.0.0 to install Emissary 4.0.0).

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Emissary's Helm charts are now available only from the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: By default, the Emissary CRD Helm chart will not enable the conversion webhook that supports Emissary's `v1` and `v2` CRDs. To enable the webhook:

  - Set `enableLegacyVersions: true` to enable the conversion webhook with support for `v2` CRDs.

  - Also set `enableV1: true` to additionally support `v1` CRDs. There is no way to support only `v1` CRDs.

### Changes

- Fix: Correctly distinguish Mappings that differ only by `weight`, even when some weights are missing (thanks, [sekar-saravanan]!).

- Fix: Generate correct cache keys for Mappings using `header_regex` match conditions (thanks, [sekar-saravanan]!).

- Fix: Document the `loadBalancerSourceRanges` value in the Helm chart (thanks, [Abhay Bothra]!).

- Fix: The Helm chart no longer sets a CPU limit on Emissary's deployments (thanks, [Frederic Mereu]!).

- Fix: The Helm chart's `initContainers` are now correctly indented (thanks, [Catalin Codreanu]!).

- Fix: The Helm chart now correctly restores the `HOST_IP` value for tracing providers (thanks, [Tenshin Higashi]!)

- Fix: When the conversion webhook is active and Emissary is instructed to wait for the webhooks at boot time, this is now completely internal rather than requiring an extra init container.

- Fix: When trying to use environment variables to tell the conversion webhook _not_ to manage aspects of its certificate, don't invert the meaning of the environment variables.

- Feature: Emissary now supports both `arm64` and `amd64` architectures using multiarch Docker images.

- Feature: When the `emissary-apiext` deployment is in use, the Helm chart correctly sets its `securityContext` (thanks, [Frederic Mereu]!).

- Feature: The Helm chart can now supply a `loadBalancerClass` on Emissary's Services (thanks, [Sunny Kumar]!).

- Feature: The Helm chart supports setting the IP address family for Emissary's Services, and disabling the creation of a Module entirely (thanks, [Pier]!).
