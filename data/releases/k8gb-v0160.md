# Release Summary

K8GB v0.16.0 delivers **comprehensive multi-cloud DNS automation** with automated zone delegation now supporting all three major cloud providers: AWS Route53, Azure DNS, and **newly added GCP Cloud DNS**. This milestone enables seamless global load balancing across any combination of cloud environments without manual DNS configuration.

# Key Highlights:

- **GCP Cloud DNS Support**: Complete integration with Google Cloud Platform, including automated zone delegation, comprehensive documentation, and end-to-end testing. K8GB now covers AWS, Azure, and GCP with full automation.

- **LoadBalancer Service Support**: Extended global load balancing to Layer 4 with Kubernetes LoadBalancer Services support via hostname annotations, complementing existing Ingress capabilities.

- **Upstream External-DNS Migration**: Migrated to upstream external-dns chart for all DNS providers (AWS Route53, Azure DNS,
Cloudflare, NS1, RFC2136), improving maintainability and feature parity with the broader ecosystem.

This release includes 90+ improvements with enhanced Infoblox integration, CoreDNS hot-reload support, pod tolerations, and updated dependencies including Go 1.25.2 and Kubernetes API machinery v0.34.1.
