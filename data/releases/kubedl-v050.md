# Features

In this release, we have brought some major features that helps cluster admins to manage workloads easier and run more effciently.

1. Enable data caching across different jobs and decouple lifecycle between job and cache system.
2. Introduce job-coordinator to schedule and admit jobs in multi tenants queues.
3. Introduce a new workload named ElasticBatch job, which abstracts offline inference jobs.
