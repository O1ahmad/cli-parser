Apache Kudu 1.17.1 is a maintenance release which fixes several bugs and build issues seen in Kudu 1.17.0.

Upgrade Notes
=============

Fixed Issues
============

-   Fixed issue where unexpected behavior was seen when trying to drop  an unbounded range in a table using hash and range partitioned  schema and created in Kudu 1.16.0 or earlier (see [KUDU-3515](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3515)).

-   Upgraded 3rd-party libunwind to fix issues seen with aarch64, in particular Graviton3 instances.

-   Fixed issue where flushing of data in batches causes index out of bound exception if the table schema has changed (see [KUDU-3483](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3483)).

-   Fixed crash of Kudu servers when system time is being synchronized by PTPd (see [KUDU-3521](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3521)).

-   Fixed file descriptor leak issue when issues are encountered during encryption-at-rest (see [KUDU-3520](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3520)).

-   Fixed bug in range-aware tablet replica placement causing Kudu master to crash (see [KUDU-3532](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3532)).

-   Fixed NPE thrown by Kudu Java client when establishing a connection to a Kudu server in busy clusters.

-   Fixed issue when changing multi-master configuration through kudu command line tools (see [KUDU-3491](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3491)).

-   Do not expose non-arithmetic gauges via Prometheus metrics. (see [KUDU-3549](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3549)).

-   Optimizations around tombstoned tablets to reduce resource usage in specific scenarios (see [KUDU-3486](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3486) and [KUDU-3535](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3535)).

-   Fixed the IN-list predicate pruning to get the right hash schema  based on specific partition’s lower bound key (see  [KUDU-3564](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3564)).

-   Fixed the issue of unexpectedly setting a newly added column cell to its default value when a C++ client application was using stale table schema (see [KUDU-3495](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3495)).

-   Fixed scan issues where an unexpected predicate was introduced (see [KUDU-3518](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3518)).

-   Upgraded Netty to version 4.1.110.Final, addressing the well-known [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44487).

-   Removed the dependency on sse2neon by rewriting SSE2 and AVX code with native NEON instructions.

-   Upgraded 3rd-party curl to version 8.4.0.

-   Upgraded 3rd-party gperftools to version 2.13.

-   Fixed integer overflow in available space metrics (see [KUDU-3562](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3562)).

-   Fixed an issue where altering the number of columns in tables with per-range hash schemas causes the table to become unusable (see [KUDU-3577](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3577)).

-   Fixed heap-use-after-free and data races in MajorDeltaCompactionOp when AlterTablet is running (see [KUDU-3570](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3570)).

-   Fixed data race in CFileSet::Iterator::OptimizePKPredicates() (see [KUDU-3569](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3569)).

-   Fixed memory barriers in concurrent binary tree implementation which causes failures in ARM platform as ARM allows stores to memory locations not necessarily in program order.

-   Fixed an issue where major compactions would fail on empty rowsets due to a regression from a previous fix (see [KUDU-3619](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3619)).

-   Fixed heap-use-after-free and undefined behavior in OpDriver (see [KUDU-3620](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-3620)).

-   Added support for Python versions 3.9 and 3.10.

-   Simplified setting up of Kudu Python client by automatically installing the supported version of Cython during the setup process.

-   Fixed docker scripts for Ubuntu 22.04 and later to use Python3 to deal with the Python package name changes.

-   Discontinued support for Python versions 3.0 to 3.5.
