# Ratify - v2.0.0-alpha.1

**Release Name**: V2.0.0-alpha.1
**Published**: 2025-06-23T02:45:21Z
**Repository**: https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify

---

## 🚨 Breaking Changes
- **Modularization**: The core workflow has been decoupled into a new standalone library, [ratify-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify-go), with a new extensible framework support implemented across all major modules: Executor, Verifier, Store, and Policy Enforcer [#2231](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2231) [#2235](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2235) [#2237](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2237) [#2238](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2238)
- **Key Management Changes**: The Key Management Provider has been deprecated. Key configuration now resides under the verifier section. [#2231](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2231)
- **Plugin Artifact Download Removed**:Verifier plugins are no longer downloaded as artifacts [#2231](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2231)
- **New HTTP Server & Entrypoint**: A new v2 HTTP server has been introduced under the binary name `ratify-gatekeeper-provider`, replacing the previous `ratify` entrypoint.
- **Helm Chart for v2**: Released a new Helm chart that packages the `ratify-gatekeeper-provider` v2 image for streamlined deployment. [#2207](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2207)
- **Enhanced Security Defaults**: mTLS is enabled by default now. Certificate rotation is configured out of the box to strengthen security posture. [#2242](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2242)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Multiple Store Config Support**: Fixed a limitation in v1 to allow configuring multiple stores with different scopes. [#2235](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2235)
- **Helmfile Compatibility**: Updated Helmfile templates to use .gotmpl extension, ensuring compatibility with Helmfile v1.0.0. [#2218](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2218)

## 📄 Documentation
- **New Helm Chart Docs**: Added a comprehensive README.md for the new Helm chart. [#2262](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2262)
- **v2 Development Info**: Published a Ratify v2 roadmap and development notice. [#2197](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2197) [#2194](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2194)

## ⚙️ CI/CD & Automation
- **Automated Dev Releases**: On merge to main, both the Helm chart and container image are now automatically built and published. [#2288](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2288)
- **Updated CI Pipelines**: Disabled v1 jobs and added new workflows for building and testing v2 on the main branch. [#2228](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2228) [#2221](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2221) [#2263](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2263) [#2266](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/pull/2266)

## 🚨 Comparing v2.0.0-alpha.1 with v1.x

Notation verifier is supported in Ratify v2.0.0-alpha.1.

Some features are not yet available in this release and planned to be supported in upcoming releases. Refer to this page to track the progress: https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/discussions/2236

The following features in v1.x will be ported to v2.0 and future releases:

- Ratify server configuration via CRDs
- Cloud provider integrations (Azure, AWS, Alibaba)
- Rego policy support
