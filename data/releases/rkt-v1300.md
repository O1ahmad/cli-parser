This release includes some small command line tweaks and adds support for CRI logging in iottymux which is required by rktlet.
It also fixes a number of bugs, adds a lot of new documentation, and updates some dependencies.

### New features

- status: added read from uuid-file ([#3860](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3860)).
- stage0/run: relax '--hosts-entry' parser ([#3833](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3833)).
- iottymux: store logs for kubelet in the appropriate location ([#3798](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3798)). This change is made for rktlet. iottymux will store the logs directly in the CRI format.
- rkt: add AWS auth headerer support to `rkt config` ([#3910](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3910)).

### Bugfixes

- kvm: solve certain routing issues by using the same default bridge as CNI ([#3905](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3905)).
- networking/portfwd: fix compare routeLocalnetValue ([#3897](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3897)).
- list: add ip of non-running pods to status output ([#3857](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3857)).
- stage1: execute pre-start/post-stop hooks as privileged ([#3844](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3844)). Even if we run the container as an unprivileged user.
- stage1-fly/run: allow non absolute commands to be run ([#3845](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3845)).
- rkt: prevent skipping some images in image gc ([#3858](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3858)).
- rkt: skip parsing in case of an empty string ([#3822](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3822)). Fix issue where `rkt app add` fails with an error message like `must give only one app`, even when only one app name is given.

### Build system

- scripts: Add libfdt to install deps ([#3834](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3834)). libfdt-dev is needed when building kernels for architectures that support a device tree.
- makelib: Fix go-find-directories symlink problem ([#3824](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3824)).
- scripts: adding missing dependecies to debian dependency installer ([#3829](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/pull/3829)).
