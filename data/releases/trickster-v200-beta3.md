**And we are back.** At long last, welcome to Trickster 2.0 Beta 3! Finally! 🎉 

Trickster is now better than ever and even faster. 🚀

This release is the result of a massive, monthslong overhaul, upgrade and modernization of the entire Trickster project. We've eliminated over 70 data race conditions, a bunch of panics and a few deadlocks; sped up _literally everything_ through refactors; and improved compatibility with InfluxDB and ClickHouse - all while adding dozens of new features. The [What's New in Trickster 2.0](https://github.com/trickstercache/trickster/blob/main/docs/new-changed-2.0.md) page has an exhaustive list of all the stuff we've crammed into Beta 3. We also have [refreshed the roadmap](https://github.com/trickstercache/trickster/blob/main/docs/roadmap.md), so you can see where things are headed over the course of the year.

We'd love for you to please check out the docs, try out Beta3 and report any issues you find. On that note, welcome to new contributors @trumant and @tonychoe.

Finally, a very special shoutout to maintainer @crandles for dedicating countless nights and weekends to get this release across the finish line. 🙏
