A\n  successful authentication results in a Vault token - conceptually similar to\n  a session token on a website. By default, this token is cached on the local\n  machine for future requests.\n\n  The default auth method is \"token\". If not supplied via the CLI,\n  Vault will prompt for input. If the argument is \"-\", the values are read\n  from stdin.\n\n  The -method flag allows using other auth methods, such as userpass, github, or\n  cert. For these, additional \"K=V\" pairs may be required. For example, to\n  authenticate to the userpass auth method:\n\n      $ vault login -method=userpass username=my-username\n\n  For more information about the list of configuration parameters available for\n  a given auth method, use the \"vault auth help TYPE\" command. You can also use\n  \"vault auth list\" to see the list of enabled auth methods.\n\n  If an auth method is enabled at a non-standard path, the -method flag still\n  refers to the canonical type, but the -path flag refers to the enabled path.\n  If a github auth method was enabled at \"github-prod\", authenticate like this:\n\n      $ vault login -method=github -path=github-prod\n\n  If the authentication is requested with response wrapping (via -wrap-ttl),\n  the returned token is automatically unwrapped unless:\n\n    - The -token-only flag is used, in which case this command will output\n      the wrapping token.\n\n    - The -no-store flag is used, in which case this command will output the\n      details of the wrapping token.\n\nHTTP Options:\n\n  -address=<string>\n      Address of the Vault server. The default is https://127.0.0.1:8200. This\n      can also be specified via the VAULT_ADDR environment variable.\n\n  -agent-address=<string>\n      Address of the Agent. This can also be specified via the\n      VAULT_AGENT_ADDR environment variable.\n\n  -ca-cert=<string>\n      Path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded CA certificate to verify\n      the Vault server's SSL certificate.

If this flag is specified,\n      -client-key is also required. This can also be specified via the\n      VAULT_CLIENT_CERT environment variable.\n\n  -client-key=<string>\n      Path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded private key matching the\n      client certificate from -client-cert. This can also be specified via the\n      VAULT_CLIENT_KEY environment variable.\n\n  -disable-redirects\n      Disable the default client behavior, which honors a single redirect\n      response from a request The default is false. This can also be specified\n      via the VAULT_DISABLE_REDIRECTS environment variable.\n\n  -header=<key=value>\n      Key-value pair provided as key=value to provide http header added to any\n      request done by the CLI.Trying to add headers starting with 'X-Vault-'\n      is forbidden and will make the command fail This can be specified\n      multiple times.\n\n  -mfa=<string>\n      Supply MFA credentials as part of X-Vault-MFA header. This can also be\n      specified via the VAULT_MFA environment variable.\n\n  -namespace=<string>\n      The namespace to use for the command. Setting this is not necessary\n      but allows using relative paths. -ns can be used as shortcut. The\n      default is (not set). This can also be specified via the VAULT_NAMESPACE\n      environment variable.\n\n  -non-interactive\n      When set true, prevents asking the user for input via the terminal. The\n      default is false.\n\n  -output-curl-string\n      Instead of executing the request, print an equivalent cURL command\n      string and exit.

The default is (not set).\n\n  -wrap-ttl=<duration>\n      Wraps the response in a cubbyhole token with the requested TTL. The\n      response is available via the \"vault unwrap\" command. The TTL is\n      specified as a numeric string with suffix like \"30s\" or \"5m\". This can\n      also be specified via the VAULT_WRAP_TTL environment variable.\n\nOutput Options:\n\n  -field=<string>\n      Print only the field with the given name. Specifying this option will\n      take precedence over other formatting directives. The result will not\n      have a trailing newline making it ideal for piping to other processes.\n\n  -format=<string>\n      Print the output in the given format. Valid formats are \"table\", \"json\",\n      \"yaml\", or \"pretty\". \"raw\" is allowed for 'vault read' operations only.\n      The default is table. This can also be specified via the VAULT_FORMAT\n      environment variable.\n\nCommand Options:\n\n  -method=<string>\n      Type of authentication to use such as \"userpass\" or \"ldap\". Note this\n      corresponds to the TYPE, not the enabled path. Use -path to specify the\n      path where the authentication is enabled. The default is token.\n\n  -no-print\n      Do not display the token. The token will be still be stored to the\n      configured token helper. The default is false.\n\n  -no-store\n      Do not persist the token to the token helper (usually the local\n      filesystem) after authentication for use in future requests. The token\n      will only be displayed in the command output. The default is false.\n\n  -path=<string>\n      Remote path in Vault where the auth method is enabled. This defaults to\n      the TYPE of method (e.g. userpass -> userpass/).\n\n  -token-only\n      Output only the token with no verification. This flag is a shortcut for\n      \"-field=token -no-store\". Setting those flags to other values will have\n      no affect. The default is false.",

Using this option is highly\n      discouraged as it decreases the security of data transmissions to and\n      from the Vault server. The default is false. This can also be specified\n      via the VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY environment variable.\n\n  -unlock-key=<string>\n      Key to unlock a namespace API lock. The default is (not set).\n\n  -wrap-ttl=<duration>\n      Wraps the response in a cubbyhole token with the requested TTL. The\n      response is available via the \"vault unwrap\" command. The TTL is\n      specified as a numeric string with suffix like \"30s\" or \"5m\". This can\n      also be specified via the VAULT_WRAP_TTL environment variable.\n\nOutput Options:\n\n  -format=<string>\n      Print the output in the given format. Valid formats are \"table\", \"json\",\n      \"yaml\", or \"pretty\". \"raw\" is allowed for 'vault read' operations only.\n      The default is table. This can also be specified via the VAULT_FORMAT\n      environment variable.\n\nCommon Options:\n\n  -key-shares=<int>\n      Number of key shares to split the generated root key into. This is the\n      number of \"unseal keys\" to generate. This is aliased as \"-n\".\n\n  -key-threshold=<int>\n      Number of key shares required to reconstruct the root key. This must be\n      less than or equal to -key-shares. This is aliased as \"-t\".\n\n  -pgp-keys=<keybase:user1, keybase:user2, ...>\n      Comma-separated list of paths to files on disk containing public PGP\n      keys OR a comma-separated list of Keybase usernames using the format\n      \"keybase:<username>\". When supplied, the generated unseal keys will be\n      encrypted and base64-encoded in the order specified in this list. The\n      number of entries must match -key-shares, unless -stored-shares are\n      used.\n\n  -root-token-pgp-key=<keybase:user>\n      Path to a file on disk containing a binary or base64-encoded public PGP\n      key. This can also be specified as a Keybase username using the format\n      \"keybase:<username>\". When supplied, the generated root token will be\n      encrypted and base64-encoded with the given public key.\n\n  -status\n      Print the current initialization status. An exit code of 0 means the\n      Vault is already initialized. An exit code of 1 means an error occurred.\n      An exit code of 2 means the Vault is not initialized. The default is\n      false.\n\n  -stored-shares=<int>\n      DEPRECATED: This flag does nothing. It will be removed in Vault 1.3. The\n      default is -1.\n\nConsul Options:\n\n  -consul-auto\n      Perform automatic service discovery using Consul in HA mode. When\n      all nodes in a Vault HA cluster are registered with Consul, enabling\n      this option will trigger automatic service discovery based on the\n      provided -consul-service value. When Consul is Vault's HA backend,\n      this functionality is automatically enabled. Ensure the proper Consul\n      environment variables are set (CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR, etc). When only one\n      Vault server is discovered, it will be initialized automatically. When\n      more than one Vault server is discovered, they will each be output for\n      selection. The default is false.\n\n  -consul-service=<string>\n      Name of the service in Consul under which the Vault servers are\n      registered. The default is vault.\n\nAuto Unseal Options:\n\n  -recovery-pgp-keys=<keybase:user1, keybase:user2, ...>\n      Behaves like -pgp-keys, but for the recovery key shares. This is only\n      used in Auto Unseal mode.\n\n  -recovery-shares=<int>\n      Number of key shares to split the recovery key into. This is only used\n      in auto-unseal mode.\n\n  -recovery-threshold=<int>\n      Number of key shares required to reconstruct the recovery key. This is\n      only used in Auto Unseal mode.",

This can also be specified\n      via the VAULT_DISABLE_REDIRECTS environment variable.\n\n  -header=<key=value>\n      Key-value pair provided as key=value to provide http header added to any\n      request done by the CLI.Trying to add headers starting with 'X-Vault-'\n      is forbidden and will make the command fail This can be specified\n      multiple times.\n\n  -mfa=<string>\n      Supply MFA credentials as part of X-Vault-MFA header. This can also be\n      specified via the VAULT_MFA environment variable.\n\n  -namespace=<string>\n      The namespace to use for the command. Setting this is not necessary\n      but allows using relative paths. -ns can be used as shortcut. The\n      default is (not set). This can also be specified via the VAULT_NAMESPACE\n      environment variable.\n\n  -non-interactive\n      When set true, prevents asking the user for input via the terminal. The\n      default is false.\n\n  -output-curl-string\n      Instead of executing the request, print an equivalent cURL command\n      string and exit. The default is false.\n\n  -output-policy\n      Instead of executing the request, print an example HCL policy that would\n      be required to run this command, and exit. The default is false.\n\n  -policy-override\n      Override a Sentinel policy that has a soft-mandatory enforcement_level\n      specified The default is false.\n\n  -tls-server-name=<string>\n      Name to use as the SNI host when connecting to the Vault server via TLS.\n      This can also be specified via the VAULT_TLS_SERVER_NAME environment\n      variable.\n\n  -tls-skip-verify\n      Disable verification of TLS certificates. Using this option is highly\n      discouraged as it decreases the security of data transmissions to and\n      from the Vault server. The default is false. This can also be specified\n      via the VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY environment variable.\n\n  -unlock-key=<string>\n      Key to unlock a namespace API lock. The default is (not set).\n\n  -wrap-ttl=<duration>\n      Wraps the response in a cubbyhole token with the requested TTL. The\n      response is available via the \"vault unwrap\" command. The TTL is\n      specified as a numeric string with suffix like \"30s\" or \"5m\". This can\n      also be specified via the VAULT_WRAP_TTL environment variable.\n\nOutput Options:\n\n  -field=<string>\n      Print only the field with the given name. Specifying this option will\n      take precedence over other formatting directives. The result will not\n      have a trailing newline making it ideal for piping to other processes.\n\n  -format=<string>\n      Print the output in the given format. Valid formats are \"table\", \"json\",\n      \"yaml\", or \"pretty\". \"raw\" is allowed for 'vault read' operations only.\n      The default is table. This can also be specified via the VAULT_FORMAT\n      environment variable.\n\nCommand Options:\n\n  -display-name=<string>\n      Name to associate with this token. This is a non-sensitive value that\n      can be used to help identify created secrets (e.g. prefixes).\n\n  -entity-alias=<string>\n      Name of the entity alias to associate with during token creation. Only\n      works in combination with -role argument and used entity alias must be\n      listed in allowed_entity_aliases. If this has been specified, the entity\n      will not be inherited from the parent.\n\n  -explicit-max-ttl=<duration>\n      Explicit maximum lifetime for the token. Unlike normal TTLs, the maximum\n      TTL is a hard limit and cannot be exceeded. This is specified as a\n      numeric string with suffix like \"30s\" or \"5m\".\n\n  -id=<string>\n      Value for the token. By default, this is an auto-generated string.\n      Specifying this value requires sudo permissions.\n\n  -metadata=<key=value>\n      Arbitrary key=value metadata to associate with the token. This metadata\n      will show in the audit log when the token is used. This can be specified\n      multiple times to add multiple pieces of metadata.\n\n  -no-default-policy\n      Detach the \"default\" policy from the policy set for this token. The\n      default is false.\n\n  -orphan\n      Create the token with no parent. This prevents the token from being\n      revoked when the token which created it expires. Setting this value\n      requires root or sudo permissions. The default is false.\n\n  -period=<duration>\n      If specified, every renewal will use the given period. Periodic tokens\n      do not expire (unless -explicit-max-ttl is also provided). Setting this\n      value requires sudo permissions. This is specified as a numeric string\n      with suffix like \"30s\" or \"5m\".\n\n  -policy=<string>\n      Name of a policy to associate with this token. This can be specified\n      multiple times to attach multiple policies.\n\n  -renewable\n      Allow the token to be renewed up to it's maximum TTL. The default is\n      true.\n\n  -role=<string>\n      Name of the role to create the token against. Specifying -role may\n      override other arguments. The locally authenticated Vault token must\n      have permission for \"auth/token/create/<role>\".\n\n  -ttl=<duration>\n      Initial TTL to associate with the token. Token renewals may be able to\n      extend beyond this value, depending on the configured maximum TTLs. This\n      is specified as a numeric string with suffix like \"30s\" or \"5m\".\n\n  -type=<string>\n      The type of token to create. Can be \"service\" or \"batch\". The default is\n      service.\n\n  -use-limit=<int>\n      Number of times this token can be used. After the last use, the token\n      is automatically revoked. By default, tokens can be used an unlimited\n      number of times until their expiration.",
