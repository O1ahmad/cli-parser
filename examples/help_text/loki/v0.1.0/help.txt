    	This is added to improve cacheability of recent metadata queries. Query split interval also determines the interval used in cache key. The default split interval of 24h is useful for caching long queries, each cache key holding 1 day's results.

This option only works with queriers connecting to the query-frontend / query-scheduler, not when using downstream URL.

For example, setting this to 0.5 would allow a tenant to use half of the available queriers for processing the query workload. If set to 0, query capacity is determined by frontend.max-queriers-per-tenant. When both frontend.max-queriers-per-tenant and frontend.max-query-capacity are configured, smaller value of the resulting querier replica count is considered: min(frontend.max-queriers-per-tenant, ceil(querier_replicas * frontend.max-query-capacity)). *All* queriers will handle requests for the tenant if neither limits are applied. This option only works with queriers connecting to the query-frontend / query-scheduler, not when using downstream URL. Use this feature in a multi-tenant setup where you need to limit query capacity for certain tenants.
